# Retail Sales Analysis Application

This repository contains the **Retail Sales Analysis** application, an interactive and user-friendly platform to analyze retail sales data, uncover insights, and predict sales performance using machine learning. Built with **Streamlit**, this project showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.

---

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Navigation**
- Seamless navigation between sections: Introduction, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Modeling, and Conclusion.

### 2. **Data Upload**
- Upload your CSV file containing sales data directly through the application.

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Summary Statistics**: Detailed numerical overview of the dataset.
- **Missing Values Analysis**: Visualize missing data with a heatmap.
- **Age and Gender Distribution**: Analyze customer demographics.
- **Sales Trends**: Visualize monthly and yearly sales trends.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between numerical features.
- **Bar and Scatter Plots**: Deep dive into product categories and sales metrics.

### 4. **Predictive Modeling**
- Build a **Linear Regression** model to predict total sales based on available features.
- Metrics calculated: **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R²**.
- Visualize Actual vs Predicted values and Residuals distribution.

### 5. **Comprehensive Visualizations**
- Leverages **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for detailed and visually appealing charts.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Introduction**
- Overview of the application and dataset details.
- Visual representation of retail sales concepts.

### 2. **EDA**
- Perform detailed data analysis through:
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Missing value detection
  - Distribution analysis
  - Trends and relationships between variables

### 3. **Modeling**
- Data preprocessing:
  - Encode categorical variables.
  - Scale features for better performance.
- Train-test split of the dataset.
- Train a **Linear Regression** model.
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
  - **R-squared (R²)**

### 4. **Conclusion**
- Summarize key insights and findings.
- Highlight the value of predictive modeling for sales analysis.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset should include the following key columns:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **Date**: Date of the transaction.
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for customers.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Product Category**: Category of the purchased product.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the product purchased.
- **Price per Unit**: Price per unit of the product.
- **Total Amount**: Total amount spent.

---

## Visualizations
The application generates the following charts and graphs:
- **Histograms**: Age distribution.
- **Bar Plots**: Product category sales, gender-based sales, and age group analysis.
- **Heatmaps**: Missing values and feature correlations.
- **Line Charts**: Monthly sales trends.
- **Scatter Plots**: Quantity vs Total Amount.

---

## Example Use Cases
- Identify sales trends over months and years.
- Discover customer demographics influencing sales.
- Predict future sales using machine learning.
- Visualize correlations and uncover hidden insights.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for more advanced machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Enable additional filtering options in the EDA section.
- Incorporate customer segmentation for targeted analysis.
- Integrate time-series forecasting for predictive insights.
